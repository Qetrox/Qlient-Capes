# qlient-capes

Minecraft client-sided mod that adds custom capes to minecraft.

This mod requires the Fabric API


<h3>How to equip a cape:</h3><br>
To equip a cape you need to use our discord bot <a href=https://bot.qlient.net>(link)</a> and use /set-cape.<br>
You will see a menu with all of our current capes and be able to select the cape you like.<br>
(All our capes are free, with the exception that some capes are only available to certain people)<br><br>

To see your new cape, the mod needs to reload all the cape data.<br>
This is done by going to the main menu, and clicking the "reload capes" button.

<h3>Some capes are missing their textures, what now?</h3><br>
This means that you have an outdated version, which does not have the new cape textures.<br>
To fix this, download the latest version of this mod.<br><br><br><br>

Warning: This mod overrides your Optifine cape!
